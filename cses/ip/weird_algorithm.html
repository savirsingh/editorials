<center><p style="width:60%"><b>Question:</b> Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:</p>
<p style="width:60%"><b>Solution:</b> All we need to do in this problem is read the integer n and apply the rules. We could use a while loop that breaks when n=1. Each time, it would output n (in its current form), and then apply the rules.</p>

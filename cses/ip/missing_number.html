<center><p style="width:60%"><b>Question:</b> You are given all numbers between 1,2,â€¦,n except one. Your task is to find the missing number.</p>
<p style="width:60%"><b>Solution:</b> In order to solve this problem, I read the integer n and the sequence with a missing number. I then sorted the given sequence in ascending order. I then defined a vector/list which contains the correct sequence. For 12 of 14 test cases, it suffices to just compare these two lists and output the missing number. For all marks, you must handle n=2. In this case, output the missing number as shown in the C++ solution.</p>
